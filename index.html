            <p>There's three types of procrastination. … [The] classic procrastination is consciously delaying what we
                know we should be doing. So, if I have some bills on the counter, I know that I should pay them, but I'm
                tired and I'm exhausted. So, rather than paying the bills, I'm gonna watch Netflix and chill</p>

        <div class="div-2">
            <p>Creative avoidance is different, and this is something that people do as an art form. Creative avoidance
                is subconsciously creating things for yourself to do so that you can do those things as a means of
                feeling productive, but really it's a giant scheme for avoiding doing the things you know you should be
                doing even when you don't feel like doing it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-3">
            <p>The third type of procrastination is called priority dilution, and this is fascinating, … [because]
                priority dilution is the chronic overachiever's form of procrastination. What's different about it is,
                unlike the first two, … priority dilution is not about being lazy or disengaged or distracted, but it is
                the same net result of the first two, which is... you leave the office or you end your day with your most
                significant priorities incomplete, not because you're lazy, but because you allowed your attention to
                shift to less significant but perhaps more urgent tasks.</p>>
